# Reddit Guesser v0.1.1

Type in two subreddits, and decide which title belongs to which subreddit!

[Live example](http://www.natzim.com/redditguesser/)

## Todo:

### In the near future:

- Make a branch which uses PHP to call the reddit API, so people at work or school where reddit is blocked can still use it
- Improve error reporting
- Add more options
- Make it harder to cheat
- Have the option to add more subreddits for an extra challenge

### In the distant future:

- Have an option rate your subreddit combination and submit it to an online database, where people can upvote their favourite combinations
